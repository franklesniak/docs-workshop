# Welcome

My name is Josh Hendricks and the contents of this site are intended for use during
my "Build Beautiful Documentation with platyPS and Material for MkDocs" workshop
on Monday, April 8th 2024 at the [PowerShell + DevOps Summit](https://www.powershellsummit.org/)
in Bellevue, WA.

## Synopsis

It has never been easier to build and publish documentation that is as functional
as it is beautiful. Bring your laptop, and together weâ€™ll take a bare-bones, boring
PowerShell project and generate visually appealing, responsive, searchable, online
documentation.
